.htaccess with mod_rewrite

This solution enables you to drop Laravel into your public folder then use a .htaccess file to redirect requests to the public folder. This solution places your application and core system code into a publicly accessible folder. This is not something that we encourage you to do with any PHP framework.

Step 1. Place Laravel in your document root folder.

Step 2. Place the following .htaccess file in your document root folder.

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^public
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]
</IfModule>
Step 3. Make sure that you manually set your 'url' configuration in application/config/application.php otherwise Laravel will generate incorrect URLs. Make sure that each of your environments have the correct application.url configuration.
